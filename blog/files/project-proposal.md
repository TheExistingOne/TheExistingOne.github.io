# Contender 1

## Description
Prototype (likely proof of concept, but try for a MVP) of a city building game
- Set shortly after some kind of societal collapse
- Solarpunk messages
- Godot Engine

## Learning
- Video game development in Godot Engine (Using a platform called Godot Engine to build a video game)
- Prototyping (Developing simple proof of concept versions of ideas or sketching out concepts before implementing them)
- Scripting (More minimal programming, usually used to add functionality to existing tools)
- Pixel art (Creating art on a grid by filling cells instead of using brush strokes)
- Optimization (Finding inefficiencies in the software and eliminating them or reducing their impact)
- Troubleshooting (Fixing bugs)
- Workflow building (Developing a set of processes and tools to bring an idea to fruition rapidly and efficiently)
- Brainstorming

## Learnings Life Connection
- Scripting is extremely useful in any technical field as it allows automation. It is especially useful in cyber security fields because most tools are written in scripting languages
- Prototyping is widely used as diving straight in can cause overspending and feature creep
- Since issues can appear in almost anything being able to find and troubleshoot them is always useful
- Optimization is also useful in technical fields because while small inefficiencies occasionally aren't a big deal if they come up thousands of times they start to become a problem.
- Workflow building allows you to work more efficiently as you start to get a flow going

## Product
Proof of Cconcept or Minimum Viable Product of game
Prototyping sketches & development notes
Written post-mortem

## Exhibition
Sketches & notes in notebooks
Couple of printed copies of post mortem
Game set up on laptop with Xbox controller or mouse and keyboard
Draw inspiration from indie E3 booths?



# Project One Sheet

## Description
My final product will be a video game built with the Godot Engine. The gameplay will consist of exploration and building back your city after a societal collapse. It will be based on an isometric grid using pixel and and it's aesthetics will draw inspiration from a variety of sources listed below. 

## Research
\* This research list is a living document that will be expanded as the project proceeds

- Stage 1:
  - Sit down with pen and paper and layout major game mechanics
- Stage 2:
  - Research and implement a isometric character controller
- Stage 3:

  - Begin implementing game mechanics using the following sources for reference and resources:
  - [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html)
  - [Itch.io](https://itch.io/)
  - [1001 fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/)

# Pitch

## Process
- How are you learning?
By doing. I'm already familiar with game development, so the best way to progress is to sit down and take an idea from concept to product.

- How are you gaining knowledge?
My primary guides on my research will be documentation (A written overview of the building blocks of a tool with little to no instruction on how to fit them together) and trial and error. For my skills that are not as developed such as pixel art I will use online tutorials and advice

- To ensure that I'm not just taking a shot in the dark, I will look to art as inspiration and to how other people have implemented similar systems previously
