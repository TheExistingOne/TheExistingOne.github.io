# Rebuild Demo - Post Mortem

#### Step 1: Bureaucracy
Since I was working on this as a school project, first I had to go through several planning steps. This began with submitting a project proposal to the teachers that went over objectives, what I'd learn, how that connects to my career plans, and inspirations and research. (If anyone would like to look at the full text of that you can find it [here.](mialikestech.dev/blog/files/project-proposal.md)) To finish the planning, I created [this task board](https://trello.com/b/lQRPMud6/rebuild) to track progress through the project.

##### Step 1 Takeaways
Although I have written this in a way that made it sound nice and simple, it was not. The rigidity of the instructions made some of the steps extremely difficult to execute with regards to my project. Specifically the research was required to be in APA format which did not gel well with some of my sources and the task board was supposed to be a calender which doesn't work well with my approach to development. Next project I'd like to pick something that adapts a little better to weird project requirements and try to get some more information on requirements before getting started.

#### Step 2: Planning & Drafts
With the initial planning and approval process over, I got started on my development process. A lot of my brainstorming for the overall inspiration and genre of the game was included in my project draft so I could skip most of that. Instead I sat down and worked out what tools I was going to use and the primary game mechanics.

|Tool Used|Why|
|--------|---|
|Godot Engine|I've been frustrated with Unity for a while now. Although it's really powerful, I find it's UI system quite awkward and 2D support feels like an afterthought. With this in mind I wanted to try a different game engine. I didn't really want to cough up the licensing fees for a paid engine like Construct or Game maker when my free engine was working fine even if it did annoy me sometimes. Unreal was completely overkill and I didn't like the look of their Paper2D system. Given all this, Godot was starting to look like a good choice. It was also open source and primarily 2D-oriented which were both huge pluses.|
|Aseprite|Aseprite is hands down the best pixel art tool I've ever found. It's toolset just works and I've never had an issue with it so it was kind of a no-brainer|
|GitLab|GitLab was far more of an experiment than the other tools. I've never been a huge fan of microsoft and GitHub's occasional blatent disregard for licensing terms with projects like Copilot make me hesitant to continue using them. I considered something like Gitea but I don't have access to infrastructure I would need to host a public facing instance. This led me to using GitLab since their platform was free and I could easily migrate to self hosted later if I wanted to.|
|Trello|Trello has been my task tracker for a while. I'm familiar with it and it just works making it a no-brainer|

With my tools set out I wrote out a list of features and ideas I wanted to look at implementing first:
- Flexible Building System
- Community Building Mechanics
- Tech Tree
- Power Grid style infrastructure
- Solarpunk inspired technology
- Exploration
- Crafting
